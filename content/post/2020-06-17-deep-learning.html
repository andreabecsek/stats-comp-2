<h2>Introduction to Neural Networks</h2>
<p>Neural Networks are learning algorithms inspired by the connectivity of real-life neurons, since they seem to be doing a pretty good job. The key idea is that we have various layers of inter-connected neurons. The inputs that we have form the first layer, and the aim is to obtain an output. However, between these two layers, there are numerous hidden layers that communicate with each other. Every neuron receives a set of inputs, which are weighted, summed and passed through an activation function, often a sigmoid.</p>

<p>We are going to run through a small example using the fashion MNIST database, which contains greyscale images of various fashion items. For this purpose we are going to use Tensorflow and Keras.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down step by step. We first import <code>Tensorflow</code>, load the training and test datasets from the library.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import tensorflow as tf

# Load data
dataset = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()
(x_train, y_train) = dataset[0]
(x_test, y_test) = dataset[1]</code></pre>
<p>The labels at the moment take the form of <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> different strings. To make the labels easier to work with, we use one hot encoding.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Convert labels using one hot encoding
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test)</code></pre>
<p>Now, our images are in 2D, so we need to flatten them into 1D arrays.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Convert input images to 1D
x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], -1) /255
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], -1) /255</code></pre>
<p>We use a Neural Network with a single hidden layer to begin with. We set the number of neurons in the hidden layer to be <code>8</code> and the number of classes is known and must be set to <code>10</code>. We initialize the model, add the hidden layer, and then add the output layer as follows</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Use a sequential model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()

# First hidden layer with 8 neurons
n_neurons = 8
n_classes = 10
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(n_neurons, 
                                input_dim=784, 
                                activation=&#39;relu&#39;))

# Add output layer
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(n_classes, 
                                activation=&#39;softmax&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>We must describe the specifics of training the model. The optimiser that we use is <code>adam</code>, the <code>categorical_crossentropy</code> loss function computes the cross-entropy between the predicted and actual class labels.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Specify how to train model
model.compile(loss=&#39;categorical_crossentropy&#39;, 
              optimizer=&#39;adam&#39;, 
              metrics=&#39;accuracy&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we fit the model using a 30/70 validation split and <code>5</code> epochs. An epoch is a breakdown of the data that can be passed through the model one batch at a time until the entire training dataset has been seen once. However, we are exposing the network to the entire dataset <code>5</code> times in this case so.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Fit model
n_epochs=5
model.fit(x_train, 
          y_train, 
          epochs=n_epochs, 
          validation_split=0.3)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see how the model performs on the training data. After the final epoch, we see that the accuracy is at around <code>83.6%</code>, which is pretty good.

<p>How about the performance on the test set? <code>82.22%</code>. That is still not bad given how basic this implementation is.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># Evaluate model
model.evaluate(x_test,y_test)[1]</code></pre>
